# Project: Restful API

### Task 2. Consuming and processing data from an API using Python
- Create a function `fetch_and_print_posts()` that fetches all post from JSONPlaceholder
    - Print the status code of the response i.e. `Status Code: 200`
    - If the request was sucessfull, parse the fetched data into a JSON object using the `.json()` method of the response object.
    - Iterate through the parsed JSON data and print out the titles of all the posts.
- Create a function `fetch_and_save_posts()` that fetches all post from JSONPlaceholder.
    - If the request was sucessfull, instead of printing titles, structure the data into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a post with keys and values for `id`, `title`, and `body`.
    - Using Pythonâ€™s `csv` module, write this data into a CSV file called `posts.csv` with columns corresponding to the dictionary keys.

### Task 3. Develop a simple API using Python with the `http.server` module
