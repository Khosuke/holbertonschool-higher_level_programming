number = random.randint(-10, 10)
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

### Task 1. The last digit
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

import random
number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)
# YOUR CODE HERE
```
